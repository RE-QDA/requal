To use the server version, you need to install Requal on a server or ask your organization’s IT staff to install it for you. Requal Wiki contains a basic guide for a server setup.\n\n\nDesktop version\nTo use Requal, you need to have the R language installed and running on your machine. You can download and install R from here. You will also need a web browser with JavaScript support (i.e. any of the standard issue browsers like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari).\nYou can install Requal from GitHub by following these steps (assuming you have R installed on your machine):\n\nDownload the current release of Requal from Releases. The installation file is in the requal_&lt;VERSION_NUMBER&gt;.tar.gz format.\nOpen the R console and install the remotes package by running install.packages(\"remotes\") command.\nInstall the requal package by running remotes::install_local(file.choose()) command and selecting the downloaded release file on your hard drive.\n\n\nUsage (desktop)\nAfter installation, the Requal app can be launched from the R console with the following command:\nrequal::run_app()\n\n\n\nRequal start screen\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment version\nThe development version contains the latest features, but might be less stable than a released version.\nYou can install the development version of Requal from GitHub by running this code in R:\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"RE-QDA/requal\")\nUsage is the same as in the server and desktop versions."

    "text": "Running Requal through R is and will remain the primary way to use the app. This has several advantages, including the ability to run Requal on different operating systems or access to messages sent from Requal to the R console. However, for the ease of use, we are also experimenting with a standalone version of Requal. A first version of standalone Requal for macOS is now available.\nInstructions:\nSimply download and mount the disk image file and move the Requal.app file to your Applications folder.\nAs the Requal macOS app is not certified by Apple, you will be asked for a permission to open it when running for the first time. Go to System Preferences -&gt; Security & Privacy and select Open Anyway for Requal.app.\nThis is still in experimental stage and we are providing the macOS app for beta-testing. We are curious to hear about your experience (both negative and positive) with running standalone Requal, e.g. in Requal Discussions.\nOf course, if the standalone app is not working, you can always use Requal through the standard R installation."
