Its primary objective is to enhance reproducibility in qualitative research by promoting transparency, openness, and reflexivity. The application operates cross-platform in web browsers and is fueled by the Shiny framework for the R project free software environment. Requal provides basic functionality for annotating documents in plain text with user-defined codes. The annotated text segments can be filtered and exported. Modules to enhance reproducibility help users in making their analysis more transparent and reflexive."
